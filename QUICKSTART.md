## ⚠️ Important Notes

✅ **What This Does:**
- Disguises the page appearance
- Provides quick escape to another website
- Saves all preferences locally

❌ **What This DOESN'T Do:**
- Hide browser history (use incognito mode for that)
- Block sounds from the game (use mute button on game)
- Hide what you're doing from network monitoring
- Prevent detection if someone actually clicks the page

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Q: I forgot my panic key!**
A: Open Settings (Alt + S) and record a new one.

**Q: The panic key doesn't work**
A: Make sure you're not focused on an input field. Clear the field, try again.

**Q: Settings disappeared**
A: They're in browser localStorage. Clear browser data will erase them.

**Q: Page title didn't change**
A: Click "Apply Disguise" button. The page title needs to be applied.
